**A professional Claude Code skill that turns simple instructions into production-ready prompts using adversarial evaluation and project context.**
```

### Visual Demo Section (Crucial)
*Insert immediately after the description:*
```markdown
![Prompt Optimization Workflow](assets/demo.gif)
*Watch how a vague request becomes a structured, edge-case-proof prompt in seconds.*
```

### Features (Keyword Enriched)
- **Context-Aware Optimization**: Analyzes your *entire project structure* (files, design docs) to generate relevant prompts, not generic ones.
- **Adversarial Testing**: Automatically simulates "Red Teaming" to find logical loopholes in your prompt before you run it.
- **Quantitative Evaluation**: detailed scoring system (0-100) based on clarity, specificity, and robustness.
- **Interactive Review (WebView)**: A native desktop UI (Wails) to diff, edit, and confirm changes without leaving your workflow.
